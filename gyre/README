GYRE
====

This directory contains the GYRE oscillation code suite. A full
description of GYRE, plus tools and documentation, can be found at:

http://www.astro.wisc.edu/~townsend/gyre/

Using GYRE within MESA
======================

GYRE is used internally by MESA's astero module to calculate stellar
eigenfrequencies; this capability is enabled by setting

USE_GYRE = yes

in mesa/utils/makefile_header, and then building MESA as usual (i.e.,
running ./install in mesa)

Using GYRE Stand-alone
======================

GYRE can also be run in stand-alone mode, reading stellar models
produced by MESA (or other evolution codes) from file. Details on how
to do this are given at the website referenced above.

** IMPORTANT NOTE **

The full source code for the GYRE suite is provided in the gyre
subdirectory; there's no need to download it again from the
website. When following the instructions on the website, you should
set the GYRE_DIR environment variable to point to $MESA_DIR/gyre/gyre.

Support, FAQs
=============

Please direct all questions, comments, requests for support to the
GYRE forums, linked to on the website.
