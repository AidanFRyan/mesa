Below is a short instruction how to create Type 2 tables and run the preprocessor, so you can use them in MESA. This was tested with ver. 5527. 


MESA uses 40 C/O-enriched tables for 8 different Z and 5 different X. These are their names (with Z and X value):
Gz000.x00  Gz001.x03  Gz004.x10  Gz010.x35  Gz020.x70  Gz050.x00  Gz100.x03
Gz000.x03  Gz001.x10  Gz004.x35  Gz010.x70  Gz030.x00  Gz050.x03  Gz100.x10
Gz000.x10  Gz001.x35  Gz004.x70  Gz020.x00  Gz030.x03  Gz050.x10  Gz100.x35
Gz000.x35  Gz001.x70  Gz010.x00  Gz020.x03  Gz030.x10  Gz050.x35  Gz100.x70
Gz000.x70  Gz004.x00  Gz010.x03  Gz020.x10  Gz030.x35  Gz050.x70
Gz001.x00  Gz004.x03  Gz010.x10  Gz020.x35  Gz030.x70  Gz100.x00

To generate such tables for your mixture:

- go to OPAL web site:
http://opalopacity.llnl.gov/type2inp.html
- select C and O as enhanced elements and metallicity - one of the eight values (0.000, 0.001, 0.004, 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.05, 0.1)
- provide your number fractions for elements - the column 'My Fraction'
- hit 'Normalize', provide your e-mail and data, wait for e-mail with the link to the created tables (2-3 minutes). 5 tables are generated automatically for 5 different values of X
- repeat the procedure 8 times for 8 different Z. You may hit 'back' button of your browser, so you don't need to type element fractions again, only change Z
- once your 40 tables are ready rename all of them to match the names given above

Now it is time to run the preprocessor - details are in the README file and summarized below (for OPAL type 2 a09 mix as an example):

- go to mesa/kap/preprocessor/
- unpack kap_input_data.tar.xz
- go to kap_input_data/opal/ and create a new directory for your files (Type2_A09)
- now in mesa/kap/preprocessor/ : ./clean and ./mk to build the preprocessor
- make the inlist for your files, as in example below (also attached):
-----------------------------------------------------------
&kappa
         data_dir = 'kap_input_data/opal/Type2_A09'        
         logT_file = 'logT_points'
         CO_flag = .true.
         logR_min = -8.00d0
         logR_max = 1.00d0
         logR_points = 37
         ! C and O for A09
         Zfrac_C = 0.176930
         Zfrac_O = 0.428870
         output_dir = 'data/kap_data'
         table_prefix = 'a09_co'
         header_info = 'C/O enriched -- based on Asplund et al. (2009) solar abundances'
         table_version = 36
/
-------------------------------------------------------------
- remember to set Zfrac_C and Zfrac_O according to your mixture; the table_prefix is the control you will use later in your inlist (kappa_CO_prefix in star_job)
- edit rebuild_all and add 'do_one_CO inlist_a09_CO'
- ./rebuild_all
- ./build_4_export
- cd .. (to kap) and ./build_data_and_export

You are done. Your opacity tables will be used in MESA - just provide kappa_CO_prefix in your star_job inlist
