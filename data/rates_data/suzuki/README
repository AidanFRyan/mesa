MESA includes weak reaction rates from

  Suzuki, Toki, and Nomoto (2016)
  Electron-capture and $\beta$-decay rates for sd-shell nuclei in stellar environments relevant to high-density O-Ne-Mg cores
  http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016ApJ...817..163S

These are e-capture and beta-decay rates for sd-shell nuclei (A=17-28)
obtained with USDB.  Coulomb effects are included.  Experimental
energies and GT transition strengths available are taken into account.

The following quantities are tabulated.

  density:  log_{10}(\rho Y_e)  [g/cm^3]
  temperature: log_{10}T  [K]
  chemical potential:  mu  [MeV]
  Coulomb effect parameters:
    shift in Q-value:   dQ  [MeV]
    shift in chemical potential: Vs  [MeV]
  e-capture rate or beta-decay rate:  e-cap-rate:  log_{10}(rate)  [1/s]
  neutrino energy-loss rate: nu-energy-loss: log_{10}(rate)  [MeV/s]
  gamma-ray heating rate: gamma-energy: log_{10}(rate)  [MeV/s]


We thank Prof. Toshio Suzuki for providing these tables and giving
permission for their inclusion in MESA.

These tables were downloaded from

  http://w3p.phys.chs.nihon-u.ac.jp/~suzuki/data2/link.html

on March 6, 2017.  The README included with these files indicate they
were the versions uploaded on Oct. 27, 2015.  To save disk space they
were then xz compressed.  These text-based odat files are included
with MESA in order to make their provenance clear, but are not
directly used.

The script make_suzuki_hdf5.py reads and processes the rate tables
into a version suitable for MESA to use.  The resulting HDF5 file,
Suzuki_2016.h5, is read by MESA.
