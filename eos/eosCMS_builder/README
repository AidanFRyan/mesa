Notes on adapting the Chabrier et al. (2019) EOS tables to MESA.

The original data release is in the tarball "DirEOS2019.tar.gz".

There are two parts to building MESA tables with CMS:

1. cms_mixing does the entropy of mixing calculation, blending 
   pure-H and pure-He tables into composite tables. It also 
   converts the original units of CMS (MJ, kg, etc.) to cgs.
   The entropy of mixing calculation needs to be done on PT
   tables.

2. cms_resample starts with the output of cms_mixing, which is
   a series of PT tables for a range of X,Y values. This step
   resamples the PT tables into DT (Rho,T) tables and calculates
   additional quantities required by the MESA EOS.

Some things are not provided by CMS: mu, mu_e (ln_free_e), eta.





To re-run the tables, use the build_data script.
