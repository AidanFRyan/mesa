This file documents test_rosenbrock, a programme to test the BFGS technique
used by FreeEOS using the standard Rosenbrock minimization problem.

* To build test_rosenbrock execute in the top of the build tree or else in
  utils

make check

* To run test_rosenbrock execute

./test_rosenbrock > test_rosenbrock.out_local

The output file is pretty self-explanatory.  For each iteration of the BFGS
minimization of the Rosenbrock function it give the following information:

iter: iteration number
function_count: total number of function evaluations
gradient_count: total number of gradient evaluations
x-solution: x vector minus (1., 1.) which is x vector minux the known minimum
	    of Rosenbrock's function.
dx: change in x vector from previous iteration.
step_ratio: ratio of actual step taken by line search compared to initial
	    estimate of that step size.
f: function value (which should be zero at minimum because of the way the
   	    Rosenbrock function is defined.)
gradient: gradient vector (which should be zero at minimum)
