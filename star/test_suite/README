If you copy a test suite case to use as a template,
you'll need to make some changes.  

1) edit the makefile to delete the MESA_DIR definition
   that will cause make to use the environment variable for MESA_DIR
   
2) edit the inlist to set mesa_dir = '' for same reason.

After you've done those 2 steps, you should be able to run the copied test case
from any new directory location.
