This test case produces an ONe WD using stellar engineering.  MESA
struggles to do the "real" AGB mass loss for stars over about 2 |Msun|.

A little bit of overshooting is all it takes to get the c-burn moving.
And a lot of well-timed mass loss is necessary so that the center
conditions get up to the level for C burn, but the envelope is removed
so that the run doesn't get in trouble with trying to have high mdot
at the same time as strong C burning.  If the wind is too strong from
too early, then just get a big C-O WD.  If the wind is too weak or
starts too late, then get errors such as surface ejection velocities
greater than the speed of light.
