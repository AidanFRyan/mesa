      ! Note that as the mass is reduced, eventually the Ne20 burn begins off center,
      ! and then the progress gets very slow.  it is hard to get the burning to the center.
      ! Perhaps if you are willing to let it run and run and run, it will make it.
      ! The location of the initial Ne20 ignition also depends on other parameters such as mixing.
      ! So with some choices, a given mass will start at the center, but with other it will start
      ! out at 0.5M.   I don't have a good story for this one.  Just beware.
      
      ! At the other end of the mass range, eventually the parameters that were ok for lower masses are
      ! no longer appropriate and bad things happen.   What works for 15M is not sure to work for 50M.
      ! Parameter settings that are good for 15M may be way off for 50M.  Think L/M during late burning.
