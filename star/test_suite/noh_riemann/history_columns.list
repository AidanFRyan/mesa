! log_columns.list -- determines the contents of star history logs
! you can use a non-standard version by setting log_columns_file in your inlist

! units are cgs unless otherwise noted.

! reorder the following names as desired to reorder columns.
! comment out the name to omit a column (fewer columns => less IO => faster running).
! remove '!' to restore a column.

! if you have a situation where you want a non-standard set of columns,
! make a copy of this file, edit as desired, and give the new filename in your inlist
! as log_columns_file.   if you are just adding columns, you can 'include' this file,
! and just list the additions in your file.   note: to include the standard default
! version, use include '' -- the 0 length string means include the default file.

! blank lines and comments can be used freely.
! if a column name appears more than once in the list, only the first occurrence is used.

! if you need to have something added to the list of options, let me know....


! the first few lines of the log file contain parameter values as of the start of the run
! for completeness, those items are described here:
   
   ! initial_mass -- star mass at start of run (Msun units)
   ! initial_z -- starting metallicity
   ! h1_boundary_limit -- defines abundance limit for h1_boundary_mass 
   ! he4_boundary_limit -- defines abundance limit for he4_boundary_mass
   ! burn_min1 -- 1st limit for reported burning, in erg/g/s
   ! burn_min2 -- 2nd limit for reported burning, in erg/g/s


! note: you can include another list by doing
!        include 'filename'
!        include '' means include the default standard list file


! the following lines of the log file contain info about 1 model per row
   
   ! some general info about the model
   
      model_number ! counting from the start of the run
      star_age ! elapsed simulated time in years since the start of the run
      star_mass ! in Msun units
      !star_mdot ! d(star_mass)/dt (in msolar per year)
      !time_step ! timestep in years since previous model
      log_dt ! log10 time_step
      num_zones ! number of zones in the model


      log_L ! log10 luminosity in Lsun units
      log_Teff ! log10 effective temperature
   

         rel_error_in_energy_conservation ! = error_in_energy_conservation/total_energy
         log_rel_error_in_energy_conservation

         
         rel_run_E_err ! shorter name for rel_cumulative_energy_error
         log_rel_run_E_err ! shorter name for rel_cumulative_energy_error
         
         
         
         dt_div_min_dr_div_cs
         
         

   
      !surface_accel_div_grav ! (v - v_old)/dt divided by GM/R^2 at outermost grid point
      num_retries ! total during the run
