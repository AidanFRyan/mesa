README for mesa_numerics stand-alone.


My hope is that many projects will be able to use
this without modification (beyond the usual edits
to the makefile_utils).   If that can work, then
I'd be happy to respond to questions/bug reports
concerning it.   If it can't work that way, then
naturally I'll provide (limited) advice about extracting
sources from mesa, but after that I'd be out of the loop.

The main thing included in this in addition to the solvers 
in NUM is the MTX package with the LAPACK/BLAS stuff.
If you have optimized versions of those things, you can
edit utils/makefile_header to use them (the steps are
explained there).

I've also included the sources for the interpolation
modules, but they are not part of the default install.

The small 'sample' directory contains an example
of how to use the numerics modules.  Basically,
you just need to include the 'include' directory when
you compile and load the libraries from the 'lib'
directory when you build the executable.

Cheers,
Bill Paxton
