This is based on the 2010 version of ADIPLS with some small modifications to make it work with mesa/star.

When you install mesa, ADIPLS is installed as a library that can be used directly with mesa/star.
(see the adipls/test directory for an example of this.)


If you also want to use ADIPLS "stand-alone" without the links to mesa/star, simply follow
the instructions in adipack.c/README




------


the following notes are to remind me of the changes I made to the standard ADIPLS download.



download tar files adipack, models, red-giant, star
unpack in ADIPLS directory
replace 3 makefiles by my versions
   adipls/makefile
   adiajobs/makefile
   adiajobs/sr/makefile
copy my user_adi.c.d.f to adipls
remove routines spcout_adi, modmod, and resdif from setups_adi.c.d.f (or just copy my version)

cd adipls; make
cd adiajobs; make

edit startup file -- something like this
setenv PATH /Users/bpaxton/ADIPLS/adipack.c/bin:$PATH
setenv aprgdir '/Users/bpaxton/ADIPLS/adipack.c'

test it following the instructions in readme

cd models
scan-amdl.d amdl.l5bi.d.15
redistrb.d redistrb.in
adipls.c.d adipls.c.in
freqdif.d freqdif.in

adipack.c/gensr/ofiles.c.f
adipack.c/gensr/ofiles.f
	     call system_clock(itime)
        !itime = time()


add makefile in gensr (necessary on linux?)
