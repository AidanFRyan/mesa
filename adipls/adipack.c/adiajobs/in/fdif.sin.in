Selected controls:
itype(1 - 2): itype(i) determines type of frequency from data set no i.
itype = 1: eigenfrequency, possibly corrected for perturbation
   in gravitation potential by perturbation analysis
itype = 2: uncorrected eigenfrequency (i.e. would give proper
   eigenfrequency in the cowling approximation)
itype = 3: variational frequency
itype = 4: frequency from Richardson extrapolation
Note: itype = 2 and 4 can only be used with icase = 1
   itype is meaningless for icase = 3.
ipfrq = 1: print results in terms of cyclic frequencies in muhz
ipfrq = 2: print results in terms of dimensionless frequencies
idiff = 1: relative differences
idiff = 2: absolute differences
iscdif: if iscdif = 1 scale differences by energy ratio at
   fixed frequency, normalized with surface vertical displacement.
   if iscdif = 2, use normalization with total surface displacement.
